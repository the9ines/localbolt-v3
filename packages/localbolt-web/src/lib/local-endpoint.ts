 * Host-locality check for direct-transport endpoints supplied over signaling.

 * LAN-scoped, so an endpoint may only be dialed when its host is local.
 *
 * Relationship to the ICE policy: the address-literal and mDNS rules are the
 * ICE rules, reused via isPrivateIP so there is one definition of "private
 * address" rather than a competing copy. Loopback is deliberately NOT the same:
 * isLocalCandidate has no loopback rule, and this helper adds one (see
 * isLoopbackHost). That difference is intentional and scoped to direct
 * transports — it is not a relaxation of the ICE policy, which is untouched.
 *
 * Scope: this answers "is the host local", nothing more. Which schemes a given
 * transport may dial is the caller's rule, because it differs per transport —
 * see endpointScheme and the gates in peer-connection.ts.
